# one-or-zero-rs

A program that identifies whether the number on the given image is a one or zero using machine learning in Rust.

The reason why I didn't make it to identify more numbers is because it takes a lot of time to train.

# How to run it

```
$ git clone https://github.com/vs-123/one-or-zero-rs.git
$ cd one-or-zero-rs
$ cargo run
```
